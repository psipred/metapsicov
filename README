Brief usage notes for metapsicov2
==================================

To run MetaPSICOV you need to download and install PSIPRED, PSICOV, FreeContact, CCMpred and HHBLITS, HMMER
separately. Please see relevant home pages for these packages for information on installation:
http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/psipred
http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/PSICOV
https://rostlab.org/owiki/index.php/FreeContact
https://bitbucket.org/soedinglab/ccmpred
ftp://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/pub/HH-suite
http://hmmer.org/download.html

Ensure you download HHSuite v2.x, the latest release is not supported.

You will also need the uniref90 database and the uniref100 database. You need to prepare a blast database
for uniref90 and use the hmmer esl-sfetch tool to prepare the SSI index of the uniref100 database

To compile MetaPSICOV, untar, cd to src directory and run "make" followed by "make install".

A perl script called run_metapsicov is provided for running all of the MetaPSICOV2 steps.
Before running the script please ensure that the paths at the top of the run_metapsicov script
accurately reflect the installation locations of the requisite software.
You will also need to open the jack_hhblits shell script and ensure the jackhmmer and hhdir paths
are correct.

Note also you may consider a close read of the run_metapsicov and jack_hhblits scripts to
ensure that the component software is being run with options that are compatible with your
computer or operating system

Example usage:

mkdir ~/[TEMPDIR]
cp 5ptpA.fasta ~/[TEMPDIR]
run_metapsicov 5ptpA
